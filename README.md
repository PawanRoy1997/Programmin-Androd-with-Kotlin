Jetbrans created Kotlin for two reasons: there was no language that filled all the gaps in Android development using Java libraries, and a new language would allow Android development to set trends, rather that just following them.

In Feburary 2015, Kotlin 1.0 was officially announced. It's consie, safe, pragmatic, and
focused on interoperatibility with Java code. It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, desktop or portable clients, iOT device programming, and much, much more. Kotlin gained popularity among Android developers quite rapidly, and Google's decision to adopt Kotlin as the official language of Android development resulted in interest in the language skyrocketing. Today, more the 50 percent of professional Android developers use Kotlin.
